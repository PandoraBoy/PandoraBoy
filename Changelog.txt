PandoraBoy Changelog
0.1 - Initial Release
0.2 
    * New program icon (courtesy of Jawaher Al-Ali <psyche2111@hotmail.com>) 
    * Applescript support (Rob Napier <rnapier@employees.org>)
    * Changed the shortcut system to use Shortcut Recorder 
               (http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/) 
    * Random code cleanup
    * Moved the code into a publicly available google code svn repository.
    * Made it so users can click on ads 
    
Known problems: 
    * You still cannot click on non-ad links inside of pandoraboy. This works 
      with newer version of webkit, but no the one currently used with Tiger (10.4.8) 
    * The window will not resize to remove the ad space if you have a paid 
      pandora account. 

0.3
    * Code cleanup
    * Major Growl changes. Text is different and can be localized (though no
      translations have been done yet).
    * Global notifications through NSDistributedNotificationCenter that match
      iTunes. See README.DNC.txt.
    * Major Applescript changes. See README.Applescript.txt.

Known problems:
    * Controls>Play/Pause doesn't have a key-equivalent. This generally doesn't
      matter because space will still work in almost all cases you'd care
      about, and the user can set a different key equivalent if she wants. It's
      just slightly inconsistent. The way iTunes does it seems to be highly
      non-standard and difficult to re-implement.

For the future: 
    * Better growl support (don't show multiple growl windows at once when users skip songs in rapid succession). Also, offer to install growl if the user doesn't already have it on their computer. 
    * iTunes store integration -- build a itunes store "playlist" that allows users to easily purchase songs they have heard. 
    * Log files that have been played to a file       
    * Finish LastFm support (it is partially done)
    * Replace the thumbs up / thumbs down icons with something that looks a little better
