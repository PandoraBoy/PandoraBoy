PandoraBoy Changelog
0.1 - Initial Release
0.2 
    * New program icon (courtesy of Jawaher Al-Ali <psyche2111@hotmail.com>) 
    * Applescript support (Rob Napier <rnapier@employees.org>)
    * Changed the shortcut system to use Shortcut Recorder 
               (http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/) 
    * Random code cleanup
    * Moved the code into a publicly available google code svn repository.
    * Made it so users can click on ads 
    
Known problems: 
    * You still cannot click on non-ad links inside of pandoraboy. This works 
      with newer version of webkit, but no the one currently used with Tiger (10.4.8) 
    * The window will not resize to remove the ad space if you have a paid 
      pandora account. 

0.3
    * Code cleanup
    * Major Growl changes. Text is different and can be localized (though no
      translations have been done yet). Album art is displayed in growl.
    * Global notifications through NSDistributedNotificationCenter that match
      iTunes. See README.DNC.txt.
    * Major Applescript changes. See README.Applescript.txt.
    * All links (including the backstage menu options) should work now.

0.3.1
    * Fixed global hotkeys (they were broken in 0.3)
    
0.4
    * Works now with Webkit 3 (10.5 and 10.4.11)
    * Removed redundant shortcut keys from menu items
    * Removed dependencies on frozensilicon.net
    * Moved Sparkle to googlecode

0.4.1
    * Fixed flash security error caused by local SongNotification.html
    
0.4.2
    * Fixes Apple Remote for Leopard

0.4.3
    * Fixes occassional crash due to missing key in playlist data (Issue18)
    * Added Stations menu

For the future: 
    * Better growl support (don't show multiple growl windows at once when users skip songs in rapid succession). Also, offer to install growl if the user doesn't already have it on their computer. 
    * iTunes store integration -- build a itunes store "playlist" that allows users to easily purchase songs they have heard. 
    * Log files that have been played to a file       
    * Finish LastFm support (it is partially done)
    * Replace the thumbs up / thumbs down icons with something that looks a little better
